# actionbench-

This is a temporary repository created for ISPASS submission. 

The repository contains three parts: 1

1. APK files of our mobile benchmarks. These files can be placed in a mounted Gem5 image, and can be installed inside the simulator. 

2. Gem5 scripts that can be used to launch Gem5 simulations. 

3. Source code of the benchmarks written in Java.
