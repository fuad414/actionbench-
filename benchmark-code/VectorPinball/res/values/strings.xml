    <string name="about_text">Vector Pinball 1.3.1\nÂ© 2010-2011 Brian Nenninger\nMore info: www.dozingcatsoftware.com/VectorPinball\nComments and bug reports: bnenning@gmail.com\n\nTouch the screen to start a new game, launch a ball if one is not in play, and activate the flippers.\n\n[TABLE_RULES]\n\nSelecting the Preferences button or menu item allows you to change the following settings:\n- Sound: Enables and disables sound effects\n- Background Music: Enables and disabled background music\n- Independent Flippers: When unchecked, any touch activates both flippers. When checked, you must touch the left side of the screen for the left flipper, and the right side for the right flipper. This option is only available in Android 2.2 (Froyo) or later.\n- Zoom: When checked, the view will be zoomed on the ball\'s location during game play.\n- OpenGL Rendering: Uses OpenGL to draw graphics. This improves performance on many devices, but slows down some.\n- Show FPS: When checked, shows frames drawn per second in the upper left.\n\nVector Pinball is open source; the code is at https://github.com/dozingcat/Vector-Pinball\n\nThanks to Mario at www.badlogicgames.com for code improvements and libgdx.\n\nsound, music, &amp; audio code, by pdx\nTwittering Machine\nhttp://www.twittering.com</string>

Shooting the left ramp will also advance the multiplier.\n- The game starts with ball savers in the left and right outlanes, which disappear when used. Hit all drop targets on the left or right side to restore them.\n- Hitting any group of drop targets will activate the next light in the center of the field. When the large white central light is activated, shoot the left ramp to start multiball.</string>
